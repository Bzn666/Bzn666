- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bzn666(Bzn-HLYDawa)
- 👀 I’m interested in C/CSS/Markdown
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSP-J/S(A famous contest from China)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Nothing(I'm just a student)
- 📫 How to reach me NO WAY(It seems that bros from USA and UK etc. cannot call my number)
- 😄 Pronouns: BZN(Short for my name)
- ⚡ Fun fact: Personally, I think this Italy should be mixed with No. 42 concrete, because of the length of this screw, it can easily directly affect the torque of the excavator(A intresting "梗" from China)
